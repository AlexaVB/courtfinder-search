Testing jurisdiction models
===========================

The script compares the two jurisdiction models for courtfinder: postcodes and local authorities.

It runs random postcodes in two instances of courtfinder and finds if the same or different results are returned

The area of law and geographical regions on which to run postcodes, as well as other parameters, can be set in the script
