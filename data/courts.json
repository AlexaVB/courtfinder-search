Urgent county court work will always be dealt with (including outside the counter times) but users may be directed to alternative methods of communication for certain types of county court work. This pilot does not apply to the High Court and Administrative Court - these counters will remain open from 10am until 4pm.</p>\r\n<p>For more details see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/county-court-counter-opening-hours\">http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/county-court-counter-opening-hours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thepsu.org.uk/\">The Personal Support Unit</a> supports members of the public attending Manchester Civil Justice Centre. The PSU gives practical, emotional and procedural help. If visiting the court, ask for the PSU at the front desk.
